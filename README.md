# Garbage_management_system-
This is our first project using PHP, aimed at developing a Location-Based Garbage Management System for a Smart City. Citizens can register complaints, while admins approve and manage them. The system includes dynamic tracking of dustbin deliveries and driver assignments, promoting efficient waste management.
